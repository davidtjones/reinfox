# TO DO

## AI
A conversation with Dr. Harrison, in bullet points
* Get rid of stocks in the state (every time lose: new state)
* Maybe penalize for going off stage (seems not robust)
* don't teach complex things
* curriculum learning? <3
* self play (after beating level 1 bot)
	- I think the discussion was that this was only useful after things were working
* A3C (breaks correlation)
	- useful for after mainline integration
* batch sampling (PPO) (already integrated?)
* image feature / latent representation
* discrete X/Y grid to reduce obv space
